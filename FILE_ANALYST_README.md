# üìä Financial Document Upload Analyst

An AI-powered document analysis system for verifying the authenticity of financial documents submitted for loan applications. Uses LangChain agents and GPT-4 Vision to detect fraud, assess financial health, and generate targeted follow-up questions.

## üéØ Purpose

This tool helps lending institutions analyze uploaded financial documents to:
- **Detect fraud**: Identify signs of document tampering or forgery
- **Assess authenticity**: Verify documents appear to be original and unaltered
- **Analyze financials**: Extract and evaluate cashflow patterns and financial health
- **Generate follow-ups**: Produce targeted questions to increase confidence in applications

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Multi-Agent System

The system uses specialized tools coordinated by a LangChain agent:

1. **Metadata Analyzer**: Examines PDF/image metadata for red flags
2. **Visual Inspector**: Uses GPT-4 Vision to detect visual inconsistencies
3. **Financial Analyzer**: Assesses financial patterns and cashflow

### Key Components

```
file_analyst_app.py      - Main Streamlit UI application
agent.py                 - LangChain agent orchestration
document_utils.py        - Document processing and metadata extraction
security_utils.py        - Security, audit logging, and compliance
```

- Extractable, searchable text
- Standard banking security features present

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Data Protection
- **Automatic deletion**: Files auto-delete after 24 hours
- **Audit logging**: All document access tracked
- **No persistent storage**: Analysis done in memory
- **Encrypted connections**: All API calls use HTTPS

### Compliance
- **GLBA-aware**: Designed with financial privacy regulations in mind
- **PII protection**: Sensitive data never logged in plain text
- **Data retention policies**: Configurable retention periods
- **Audit trails**: Complete access history

### File Validation
- File type verification (MIME type checking)
- Size limits (10MB max)
- Extension validation
- Malware-resistant processing

## üìä Output Structure

The agent provides:

1. **Authenticity Score**: 0-100 confidence rating
2. **Red Flags**: List of concerning findings
3. **Positive Signals**: Indicators of authenticity
4. **Follow-up Questions**: 3-5 targeted questions for applicants
5. **Recommendation**: One of:
   - `approve` - Document appears authentic
   - `review` - Manual review recommended
   - `request_more` - Additional documentation needed
   - `deny` - Strong indicators of fraud

## üîß Configuration

### API Key Setup

**Option 1: Environment Variable** (Recommended)
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

**Option 2: Streamlit Secrets**
Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:
```toml
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-key-here"
```

**Option 3: UI Input**
Enter directly in the sidebar (less secure, for testing only)

### Customization

Edit these files to customize behavior:

- `agent.py`: Modify agent prompts and tools
- `document_utils.py`: Adjust red flag detection rules
- `security_utils.py`: Configure retention policies
- `file_analyst_app.py`: Customize UI and workflow

## üìà Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis Flow

1. **Upload Document**: Drag-and-drop or select file
2. **Select Type**: Choose document type (bank statement, tax return, etc.)
3. **Analyze**: Click "Analyze Document" button
4. **Review Results**: See authenticity score, red flags, and recommendations
5. **Export**: Download JSON report for records

### Interpreting Results

**High Confidence (80-100)**:
- Original digital document
- Created with legitimate software
- No signs of tampering
- Consistent formatting and data

**Medium Confidence (50-79)**:
- Some minor concerns
- May be scanned copy
- Request additional verification
- Consider manual review

**Low Confidence (0-49)**:
- Multiple red flags detected
- Possible tampering or forgery
- Request original documents
- Strong consideration for denial

## üß™ Testing

### Test with Sample Documents

Create test cases with:
- Authentic bank statements (downloaded from real banks)
- Screenshots of statements (should flag as less trustworthy)
- PDFs created in different software (observe metadata analysis)

### Expected Behavior

**Authentic Document**:
```
‚úÖ Text extractable - original digital document
‚úÖ Created with legitimate software: Adobe Acrobat
‚úÖ High resolution with proper metadata
Authenticity Score: 85/100
```

**Suspicious Document**:
```
üö© Created with image editing software: Photoshop
üö© Text not extractable - possible screenshot
üö© Low resolution (72 DPI)
Authenticity Score: 25/100
```

## üöß Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **PDF Visual Analysis**: Requires conversion to image for vision analysis
2. **OCR Extraction**: Limited numerical data extraction from images
3. **Template Matching**: No database of known bank statement formats
4. **Cross-Document**: Can't yet verify consistency across multiple uploads

### Planned Enhancements

**Phase 2**:
- Advanced OCR with numerical data extraction
- Cashflow calculation and analysis
- Debt-to-income ratio computation

**Phase 3**:
- Multi-document cross-verification
- Template matching against known formats
- Historical upload comparison

**Phase 4**:
- Real-time bank verification (Plaid integration)
- Machine learning fraud pattern detection
- Automated decision recommendations
